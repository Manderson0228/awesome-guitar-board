# Awesome guitar board
This circuit board installs into back of your guitar where your tune/volume knobs go. It's much faster than current methods of hand soldering the circuit together. Guitars use cables to transmit their signal. Instead of sending the signal down a wire where noise will be added, I grab the signal directly from the pickups digitize it for loseless wireless transmission. This makes signal to noise better than typical designs.
